# Biomed Data Mining, Fall 2022
## Term Project#1 Motif Finding
### <font color="#f00">Due Date: 11:50PM Jan 9, 2023</font>
#### Objective of Project:
Implement a motif finding algorithm (MFA) to detect subtle motifs from DNA sequences (based on Gibbs, EM or your own design). By “implement” it means you write your own code from scratch. You are not allowed to include anyone else’s code (partial or complete) in your project. Any form of plagiarism will incur severe penalty. As a CS major (or a non-CS major but taking this course), you are expected to build your own version of MFA right from the beginning rather than simply know how to run MEME (or Gibbs sampler) available on the web because I sincerely believe you are much better than that.
#### Programming Language:
You can only use one of the programming languages, C/C++, Java or Python.
#### Evaluation:
Your MFA will be tested on several artificial data sets with various motifs. Some of
them are easy to find while others are more challenging. TAs will post some sample data sets on e3 later for you to play with, and you can debug and evaluate your MFA. For the real evaluation, TAs will post the final testing DNA sequence data sets on e3 from which your MFA will detect motif candidates.
Note. In some data sets, not every sequence contains motifs, and a sequence may contain multiple copies of motifs.
#### What to turn in:
a. A copy of your source code (be correct, i.e. it can be compiled to run),
b. A document of your code (be clear, e.g. objective functions, motif representations, search strategies, etc.) 
c. A snapshot of your input and output (i.e. user interface).
d. A list of motif candidates you identify from the testing data.
> i. Show your motifs, e.g. IUPAC-IUB, PWM or HMM, etc.
> ii. Show locations of the motif on each sequence, e.g. position 12 on seq#1, position 28 on seq#2, etc.
#### Grading policy:
a. You will get reasonable points for your project if you turn in all required even though your program is not among the top-ranking programs in class.
b. The higher ranking, the more points, of course.
c. And yes, to be fair, an incomplete project will receive a low grade.
